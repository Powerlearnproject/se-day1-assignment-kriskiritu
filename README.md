#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering involves software product design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of high quality software systems.
Software engineering is important in the technology industry as it plays a crucial role of enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C)
Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
Rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall model is linear and sequential, with each phase (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) completed before moving to the next. It's best suited for projects with clear, unchanging requirements, like building a basic information system. In contrast, Agile is iterative and flexible, allowing for continuous feedback and adaptation throughout development. It's ideal for projects with evolving requirements, such as developing a mobile app where customer feedback can drive frequent updates.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer - Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) - Provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
Version Control Systems (VCS) - Provide software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).
Testing Frameworks - Libraries and frameworks for automating the testing process and ensuring software quality (e.g., JUnit, Selenium, Jest).


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements - Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
Tight Deadlines - Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
Technical Debt - Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing - Testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing - Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing - Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing - Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs
These testings are important because  they help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 
It is important because it helps avoid  cofusing answers by making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Create a website."
Improved Prompt: "Design a responsive e-commerce website with a homepage, product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout page. Ensure it is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices."
The improved prompt is more effective because it clearly outlines the specific features required for the website, the type of website (e-commerce), and the need for responsiveness across devices. This reduces ambiguity and helps in delivering exactly what's needed.
